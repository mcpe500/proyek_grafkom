since this code is only collision detection, how to add it so that it is collision handling, so it's like a game where i can't go through the object that the result is true.
please give me the THREE JS OCTREE CODE

      function checkCollision() {
        playerCollider.start.set(
          interactibleObject.position.x - 1,
          interactibleObject.position.y,
          interactibleObject.position.z - 1
        );
        playerCollider.end.set(
          interactibleObject.position.x + 1,
          interactibleObject.position.y + 10, // Assuming the height of the capsule is 10
          interactibleObject.position.z + 1
        );

        const result = worldOctree.capsuleIntersect(playerCollider);
        if (result) {
          console.log("COLLIDED");
        }
        return result;
      }
