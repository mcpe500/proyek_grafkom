This repository contains the final project for my course, focusing on 3D graphics using Three.js. This project allowed me and my partner to gain a deeper understanding of Three.js and computer graphics, particularly in optimizing and making them more efficient.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser that supports WebGL.
- A local server to serve the HTML files. The recommended web server is **PHP**.

### Running Scripts

- **Windows**: Run the [`run.bat`](run.bat) script.
- **Linux / MacOS**: Run the [`run.sh`](run.sh) script.

### Running the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Use a local server to serve the HTML files. For example, with Visual Studio Code, you can use the Live Server extension.
4. Open the final HTML file [`grafkom_final/grafkom.html`](grafkom_final/grafkom.html) in your browser to see the 3D graphics in action.

Alternatively, you can view the project online via free hosting:

## Project Files

- **HTML Files**: Various versions of HTML files demonstrating different 3D graphics features.
  - [`grafkom_final/grafkom.html`](grafkom_final/grafkom.html): Final version demonstrating an instanced mesh and water in the scene.

- **Textures**: Contains GLTF models and textures used in the project.
  - [`textures/`](textures/): Directory containing various GLTF models like `barn.glb`, `barrel.glb`, etc.

- **Scripts**: Additional helper scripts.
  - [`resize.py`](image/resize/resize.py): Python script for resizing images.

- **Library**: External libraries used in the project.
  - [`threejs-mesh-bvh/`](library/threejs-mesh-bvh/): Three.js Mesh BVH library.
  - [`threejs-octree/`](library/threejs-octree/): Three.js Octree library.

## Acknowledgements

This project was made possible with the help of **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, and **GitHub Copilot**. These tools provided support in coding and problem-solving, allowing us to expedite the development process while ensuring a deep and thorough understanding of Three.js concepts.
